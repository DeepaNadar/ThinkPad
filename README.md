# ThinkPad: Flutter Isar Notepad App
### ThinkPad is a Flutter app that allows users to create, update, save, and delete notes using the Isar embedded NoSQL database. The app provides both grid view and list view options to display notes. It features dynamic animations and thoughtful interactions to enhance the user experience.
## Features:
1. **Empty State Animation**: If ThinkPad is empty (no notes), a Lottie animation is displayed, conveying that the notepad is currently empty.
1. **Create and Update Notes**: Users can create new notes and update existing ones seamlessly. ThinkPad leverages the power of Isar to efficiently manage note data.
1. **Delete Notes with Animation**: When deleting a note, a dialog box with a Lottie animation is presented, providing visual feedback with a message stating "This note  will be permanently deleted."
1. **Grid View and List View**: ThinkPad offers users the choice to view notes either in a grid view or list view. This provides flexibility in how users prefer to organize and interact with their notes.
